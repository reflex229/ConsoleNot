## The Description
Console notifier with desktop notifications, written in C#.
Example: the doctor prescribed you a course of treatment with pills (you need to take
the pills 6 times a day).
This program will remind you when it is the time to take the pills and sends a
desktop notification. Give these arguments &quot;-h 2 -c 6 -t -d&quot;, so the program will notify you every 2 hours,
